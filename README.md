# IssuesDiscussion

TODO: logo or something nice

The place to raise bugs, proposals, and concerns regarding any Yarn Spinner tools.

## Purpose

Yarn Spinner's tools are separated into multiple repositories to suit their modes of deployment, installation and use. However, they are often interdependent in function, and most issues or discussion in one repository will concern others. To simplify our finding of relevant issues, and clarify people's deciding where to submit issues, a single place is preferred. This also makes it clear to others that we also welcome discussion and question-type issues.

## Usage

This is the only place that we will accept issues concerning:

* [Yarn Spinner Core](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner)
* [Yarn Spinner for Unity](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity)
* [Yarn Spinner Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/VSCodeExtension)

To submit a PR, you must first open an issue to propose the change. This reduces wasted work if something is already being worked on, not desired by others, or will conflict with other functionality.

TODO: nicer wording, link to contributors info, contributors license agreement, etc.

## General Help

This is not the place for "How do I...?"-type discussion. For that, we have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yarnspinner) fully of our staff and friendly community members who can provide quick and thorough help.
