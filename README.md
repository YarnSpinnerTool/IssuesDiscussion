# IssuesDiscussion

TODO: logo or something nice

The place to raise bugs, proposals, and concerns regarding any Yarn Spinner tools.

## Purpose

Yarn Spinner's tools are separated into multiple repositories to suit their modes of deployment, installation and use. However, they are often interdependent in function, and most issues or discussion in one repository will concern others. To simplify our finding of relevant issues, and clarify people's deciding where to submit issues, a single place is preferred. This also makes it clear to others that we also welcome discussion and question-type issues.

## Limitations and Alternatives

This is not the place for "How do I...?"-type discussion. For that, we have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yarnspinner).

This is the only repository that we will accept submitted issues to from this point, and we do not accept PRs without first opening an issue to propose the change.

TODO: nicer wording, link to contributors info, contributors license agreement, etc.
