> [!TIP]
> This repo is for people to raise bugs, proposals, and concerns regarding Yarn Spinner tools. This is not the place for "How do I...?"-type discussion. For that, we have a [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yarnspinner) where our staff and friendly community members can provide you with quick and thorough help.

Yarn Spinner's tools are separated into multiple repositories to suit their modes of deployment, installation and use. However, they are often interdependent in function, and most issues or discussion in one repository will concern others. To simplify our finding of relevant issues, and clarify people's deciding where to submit issues, a single place is preferred. This also makes it clear to others that we also welcome discussion and question-type issues.

This repository is for consolidating the projects managed primarily by the core team. For projects managed by community leaders, they will still go in their respective repositories. See below for what goes where:

| Issues which go here | Issues which go in their repos |
|:---|:---|
| [Yarn Spinner Core](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner) | [Yarn Spinner for Rust/Bevy](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Rust) |
| [Yarn Spinner for Unity](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity) | [Yarn Spinner for Godot](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Godot) |
| [Yarn Spinner Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/VSCodeExtension) | |

To submit a PR, you must first open an issue to propose the change. This reduces wasted work if something is already being worked on, not desired by others, or will conflict with other functionality.
